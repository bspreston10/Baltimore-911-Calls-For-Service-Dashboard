# Business Objective
Identify trends and patterns in emergency call volume and type across Baltimore neighborhoods over time, enabling the Baltimore Police Department to optimize resource allocation and response strategies for high-priority incidents

# Insights & Recommendations

- The areas that are most affected by crime stay relatively the same throughout the years. More focus and increased police deployment in this area would be recommened to try and counteract this long run of crime in zipcode like 21215.
- The increase of overdoses has rose rapidly throughout the years. Given the rise in overdose incidents, it is crucial to establish a specialized response team trained specifically for overdose emergencies. This team should consist of both law enforcement and medical professionals (e.g., paramedics) who can handle overdose calls more effectively. Overdoses also seem to be largely localized in the zipcode 21217. Establishing mobile health units or local community outreach programs in ZIP code 21217 to provide immediate access to addiction treatment, overdose prevention education, and harm reduction services would be beneficial.
- Although total crime has increased from 2015 to 2024, certain crimes, including theft and burglary, have decreased, indicating a shift in the types of incidents that are occurring across the city. The rise in total crime suggests that while traditional property crimes are on the decline, other categories, such as violent crimes or drug-related offenses, may be contributing to the overall increase. The Baltimore PD should reallocate resources and attention toward rising crime categories like assualt.

# Next Steps
- Update the dashboard to include overdose-specific data (e.g., total overdose calls, outcomes, and response times), and add a time-series analysis to track the increase in overdoses by year, month, or even day of the week.
- Integrate external data, such as socioeconomic status, unemployment rates, or access to healthcare, to understand the root causes of overdose increases in certain areas. This can help direct community resources more effectively to address underlying issues.
- Track the success rate of overdose interventions (e.g., how many lives were saved by naloxone administration) to gauge the effectiveness of current strategies. This can help determine whether additional resources or training are needed.
